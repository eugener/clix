  🎯 Key Achievements

  ✅ High-Priority Tasks Completed:
  1. CLI Package Test Fixes - Resolved os.Exit mocking issues and version command handling
  2. App Package Function Tests - Added comprehensive tests for 0% coverage functions
  3. Core Package Middleware & Error Paths - Massive 18% coverage boost with advanced testing

  ✅ Test Infrastructure Improvements:
  - Fixed all compilation errors and test failures
  - Implemented proper mocking strategies for os.Exit scenarios
  - Created comprehensive test configurations for various edge cases
  - Added robust error path testing across all major packages

  ✅ Core Package Excellence (69.5% coverage):
  - Complete middleware testing (Logging, Timeout, Recovery)
  - Advanced error handling and propagation
  - Configuration merging and validation
  - Context management and cancellation
  - Environment variable support
  - Comprehensive edge case coverage

  The CLI framework now has a solid foundation of tests covering the most critical functionality,
  with particular strength in the core execution engine and middleware system that forms the
  backbone of the framework.
